XPINS
=====

eXtensible Program Instruction Notation/Script allows you to create scripts that integrate easily with your code

XPINS allows you to write script code that is somewhat similar to C and feed it into a compiler, which will do a few basic optimizations before you run the script. 

XPINS is licensed under the MIT License (see LICENSE.txt)

Because XPINS is OpenSource, you can actually compile your scripts at runtime if you wish. XPINS actually requires you to add a little bit of code so that you can script your own functions.
